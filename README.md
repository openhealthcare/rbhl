#### RBHL specific details
Unique to RBHL (rather than, say Opal)

We have a `field_display` template tag that accepts `model.field` as a string. This renders a display template for the field.

It takes an argument `label` for what to display as the fields display name. If this is excluded it will take it off the model field.

It takes the arguments `label_size` and `field_size` for the bootstrap `col` number. If these are absent it will look at the template context. This mean that an entire form can be structured the same way for example easily to the same sizes.

e.g.

```
{% load rbhl_panels %}


{% with label_size=4 field_size=8 %}
  {% field_display "Demographics.height" %}
  {% field_display "Demographics.post_code" %
{% endwith %}
```

Will display the below field verbose name and value in `col-md-4` for the label and `col-md-8` respectively.


#### Usersetup
User set up is done in the admin list actions. Enable OTP setup will delete the users
existing OTP and give them 10 mins to setup a new OTP.
